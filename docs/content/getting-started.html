<p>Combine is written in Python. You can follow these steps to set up a new site with combine installed.</p>

<p>This assumes that you have Python 3 and Pipenv installed...</p>

{% code "text" %}
mkdir newsite
cd newsite
pipenv install combine
mkdir content
echo "Hello!" > content/index.html
combine work
{% endcode %}

<p>Should really have a new site command or zip? with base template and stuff ready to go. </p>

<p>You'll use <code>combine work</code> while you're working on your site. It starts a local server
and automatically watches for changes and rebuilds your site.</p>
